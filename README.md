This repository contains various Jupyter Notebooks and Python code which compute weather regimes, in various different ways/domains.

The notebooks "north_american_winter_regimes" and "north_atlantic_winter_regimes" use a straightforward method for computing DJFM regimes using ERA5, and can be adapted to other domains.
